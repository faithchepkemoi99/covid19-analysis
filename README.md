# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 using the "Our World in Data" dataset. It explores trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across selected countries.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Load and clean COVID-19 data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Generate insights and identify anomalies
- Optionally map global case distribution using a choropleth

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly

## 📂 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open the notebook (`covid_analysis.ipynb`) in Jupyter
3. Run cells step by step (requires internet and `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- The United States had the fastest early vaccine rollout but later plateaued
- India experienced a major surge in April 2021 due to the Delta variant
- Kenya reported fewer cases but may be affected by underreporting
- Death rates were higher in the early phase of the pandemic
